# Data Science Portfolio for Ron Richardson

## About Me
I am currently a first year graduate student at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, studying Data Science (expected completion in May 2019). Previously, I was employeed as a lead software developer and IT Manager for 14 years. I have a strong background in web-based programming, specifically using the Microsoft stack of products (ASP.NET, SQL Server). 

This portfolio is a collection of Python and R code, which I created to showcase my education and experience in those languages and in Data Science.

In some cases, the code is part of a bigger project, which the repository will be linked to. In other cases, the code can be condensed into one file or notebook.

## Python

#### MadLibs
I created a version of MadLibs for a class project. This program lets the user choose which MadLib to use, or will pick a random one for the user. With each MadLib used, all the user entered words are logged and stats are kept on each type of word.

#### ProTracer
Another project I created is an interface for plotting and visualizing a 3D "trace" of a professional golfer's drive. Using data sourced from the PGATour, this application allows the user to select the golfer and shot and see an animation of the shot as it travels through the air. This type of visualization is now common on television broadcasts of golf tournaments.

## R

#### Learning R for Data Science

For most of my learning with R, I created a blog where I write about each topic I learn. [Learning R for Data Science](https://www.learningrfordatascience.com/) will continue to grow as I continue to increase my knowledge with R and Data Science.
