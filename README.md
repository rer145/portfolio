# Data Science Portfolio for Ron Richardson

## About Me
I am currently a first year graduate student at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, studying Data Science (expected completion in May 2019). Previously, I was employeed as a lead software developer and IT Manager for 14 years. I have a strong background in web-based programming, specifically using the Microsoft stack of products (ASP.NET, SQL Server). 

This portfolio is a collection of Python and R code, which I created to showcase my education and experience in those languages and in Data Science.

In some cases, the code is part of a bigger project, which the repository will be linked to. In other cases, the code can be condensed into one file or notebook.

## Python

#### MadLibs
I created a version of MadLibs for a class project. This program lets the user choose which MadLib to use, or will pick a random one for the user. With each MadLib used, all the user entered words are logged and stats are kept on each type of word.

#### ProTracer
Another project I created is an interface for plotting and visualizing a 3D "trace" of a professional golfer's drive. Using data sourced from the PGATour, this application allows the user to select the golfer and shot and see an animation of the shot as it travels through the air. This type of visualization is now common on television broadcasts of golf tournaments.

## Data Visualization

#### IRIS Database
The first project for this class utilizes the IRIS database from [Kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com/). This project was the first of 3, with the purpose being to visualize the data that was available and explaining each step.

#### Sleep Data
The sleep data project uses personal data collected from an iOS app called SleepCycle. This app calculates the quality of sleep by using the phone's microphone. In this project, I used that data to see if there were any correlations within the data to determine how to optimize my sleep.

#### Player of the Year
Using data from the PGA Tour, I visualized the stats for professional golfer Justin Thomas, comparing his 2016 and 2017 seasons. Thomas became the player of the year in 2017, making huge gains from 2016. The purpose of this project was to see which statistics contributed the most to his success.

## R

#### Learning R for Data Science

For most of my learning with R, I created a blog where I write about each topic I learn. [Learning R for Data Science](https://www.learningrfordatascience.com/) will continue to grow as I continue to increase my knowledge with R and Data Science.
